# Bit Art Maker

'Wait what? A 64x64 pixel art NFT sold for $10 million? I could've easily drawn one in a few minutes.' If you have a similar reaction as I did, then this web app is for you. It allows you to create your NFT-styled pixel art in a simple interface.

Some templates are built into app at the right panel so that you could create your own version of, say CryptoPunk NFT, more easily.

_Caveat: There is a high chance you won't be able to sell your images for $10 million._
